An analytic solution is one that we can algebraically solve for a solution.  There exist many non-analytic problems, of which scientists and engineers want to know the solutions to.  One of the methods used to determine solutions to non-analytic problems is called Euler's Method.  Many times in these labs we will still be working with functions that have known analytic solutions, and comparing to Euler's Method.  By doing this with solutions we know, we can verify that our solution method will still work for problems we don't have known solutions to.\n",
