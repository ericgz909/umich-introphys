Digitization of introductory physics labs at University of Michigan, Mechanics and E&amp;M for general physics students.

The Mechanics labs were written by the University of Michigan DIALUP team, led by Grace Kerber and edited by Lead GSI Eric Gonzalez.

The E&M labs were written by Eric Gonzalez based on work done by previous Lead GSIs and instructors with pen and paper lab assignments. 

The Online Platforming notebook was written by Eric Gonzalez, edited by Nathaniel Lydick and Blake Hipsley. The online platforming notebook integrates Zoom, Canvas, and CoCalc API for a seamless online learning experience where students can communicate and collaborate during remote lab learning sessions.
